# NixOS and home-manager configurations

This repo holds my nix configurations.

## Flakes

The configurations use nix flakes.

I followed [this guide](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/nixos-with-flakes-enabled) to get nixos and home-manager running using a flake.

Uses [my neovim config](https://github.com/Samyak2/nvim-config) as an input.

## Hosts

Currently running on these hosts:
- PC with NixOS unstable (also uses home-manager unstable)
